Use JavaScript to create a guessing (flip) game.

- User selects the number of images to be displayed in game: 8, 10, 12
- User selects the difficulty level: Hard (3 seconds), Medium (5 seconds), Easy (8 seconds) to memorize before images hidden
- Table with 8, 10 or 12 images is displayed (2 of each: so 16, 20, or 24)
- Images need to be distributed randomly
- Have start button to start
- Provide user with guidelines on how to play
- User matches each image with its copy
- If wrong, images are flipped back around
- If not wrong, they're left flipped
- Images must finish animation before user can continue
- Game should be timed: 120 seconds for 8 photos, 150 seconds for 10 photos and 180 seconds for 12 photos
